Discord screenshots auto sender

Just a little tool to detect when you save a screenshot in your screenshots folder, and send it straight to your Discord server via webhook.
Usage:
1.Create a webhook on your Discord server (or use existing one) and copy it's URL.
2.Launch app
3.Insert URL in the first text box.
3.1.Recommended: press "Send test" and if you have entered URL correctly and Discord is not down, you should get picture sent to your webhook channel.
4.Browse or manually enter path to the folder, where your screenshots go.(If the path requires administator rights, run the app as administrator)
5.Press "Start". Screenshots will be tracked from now on. You can minimize the app and it will go in your notification area.

If you hear notification sound after you take a screenshot, it usually means that the file failed to sent due to internet problems.
