Discord screenshots auto sender<br/>
<br/>
Just a little tool to detect when you save a screenshot in your screenshots folder, and send it straight to your Discord server via webhook.<br/>
Usage:<br/>
1.Create a webhook on your Discord server (or use existing one) and copy it's URL.<br/>
2.Launch app<br/>
3.Insert URL in the first text box.<br/>
3.1.Recommended: press "Send test" and if you have entered URL correctly and Discord is not down, you should get picture sent to your webhook channel.<br/>
4.Browse or manually enter path to the folder, where your screenshots go.(If the path requires administator rights, run the app as administrator)<br/>
5.Press "Start". Screenshots will be tracked from now on. You can minimize the app and it will go in your notification area.<br/>
<br/>
If you hear notification sound after you take a screenshot, it usually means that the file failed to sent due to internet problems.<br/>
